This approach seeks to simplify interfaces by removing unnecessary elements or content that does not support user tasks.

EXAMPLES ARE FOUND IN THE DESIGN RESOURCES FOLDER

-Flat patterns and textures
	no use of highlights, shadows, gradients or textures that make UI elements glossy or three-dimensional
	this applies to textures, icons or graphics in an interface (it is not the same as minimalistic, because the concept applies to the design of the layout in general. So a design can be flas without being minimalist.
	-NOTE:
		Flat buttons or links may be difficult to be recognized by the user.
	THE MAIN DIFFICULTY OF FLAT DESIGN IS THAT IF USED WRONGLY CAN REALLY DEGRADE THE USER EXPERIENCE

-Color palette
	Color is used strategically to create visual interest or direct attention without adding any additional design elements or actual graphics.
	Obviously, with less visual information the user is more influenced by the color palettes and notices them more.
	Most websites use a monochromatic palette, but the best choice to me is use a main color - easy and soft on the eye - and 1 or 2 stronger colors as an accent, to highlight (with parsimony) the most important elements (like clickable ones).
	Those should highlight primary actions that the user should do (use accent and contrast to convey the user into doing the actions you want) or very important information.
	The most attention on the accented contents is given by an high contrast between the main color and the accent color.
