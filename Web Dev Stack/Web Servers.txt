(If the server doesn't find the requested document it returns a 404 response instead).
A web serve can be either static or dinamic:
-A static web server consists of a comuputer with an HTTP server installed.
-A dynamic web server consists of a static web server plus extra software, like  an application server and a database. It is called dynamic because the application server updates the hosted files before sending content to the browser via HTTP.

-The HTTP srever first checks if the requested URL matches an ex
